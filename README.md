Black Box parameters estimation on MATLAB for minimum error

- **Simulation and Modeling of Dynamic Systems Project**
    - This is a project that aims to identify and analyze unknown linear systems using various methods and techniques.
    - It consists of three main questions that are explained in detail in the report.
- **Question 1: Proof of linearity**
    - This question tests whether an unknown system is linear or not by checking the properties of homogeneity and superposition.
    - It uses MATLAB to record the input and output measurements and compare them with different scaling factors and combinations.
    - It concludes that the unknown system is linear with minimal error.
- **Question 2: Parameter estimation**
    - This question tries to estimate the parameters of the unknown system using offline and online methods.
    - It uses the least squares method for the offline method and the gradient method for the online method.
    - It tests different models of first and second order systems and compares the results.
- **Question 3: Evaluation**
    - This question evaluates the performance of the methods and models used in the previous question.
    - It chooses the best model based on the error convergence and the input selection.
    - It presents the diagrams and the tables that show the results.
